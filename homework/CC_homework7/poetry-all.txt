We've weathered time with the seasons going by like the
Pickets of a fence
Our friendship had endured through struggle and strife without
Leaving behind any dents
This bond that we share transcends the years
Of joy and laughter, sadness and tears
I point this out cause it's not soon you'll find
A friendship like ours that's endured over time
Would it be braggadocious to consider us elite
Others' attempts have terminated in plebeian defeat
I for one am proud to say
That yesterday and today
You've been a friend, like none could be
Thanks for the gift from you to me

Sailboat, glides the water with grace
Sailboat, dynamic and full of race
Your starboard list, your billowed sail
Your cutting bow, your trailing tail
Your varnished decks of handsome hue
Your hull restored as good as new
Your vintage lines of grace and style
Your outward pride shines all the while
I love to watch you cut the bay
I love to watch you sail my way
You take me on board and give me a ride
I guide your pleasure I feel your pride

Outrageous spectacles noticed by those
With outreageous concerns for friends and foes
To worry about others' mundane obsessions
They follow the flock in all directions
Maturity stifled, impeded by those
Who think their wisdom everyone should know
Actors, stars and game show hosts
Politicians, pontifs and writers who boast
They all feel enlightened and feel its their place
To instill us with wisdom, style and social grace
Let's not waste time with others' obsessions
Let's find our own truths, our own directions

Suddenly inculcated with the facts
Surprised by few.
It's the evening news.
Calloused cynicism building a new generation.
Don't preach those fallacious visions.
They're the coup de grace to hope.

To build a refuge all my own
A place to go to be alone
To get away from the world at large
To be safe, secluded, totally in charge
To slow the pace and do what I want
Or race around like a chicken with its head cut off
This is what I need to feel secure
Or maybe it would be better to stay and endure
Find a cure, feel secure within myself
Put my refuge dream back on my shelf

Push together or push apart
To seperate the mind from heart
It seems as though it's never clear
The more we think, the more we fear
Unknown, it may be known to one, not us
For in the future we put our trust
Naked souls, we hope and pray
Expose ourselves to what they say
And lives those hopes set forth by sums
Of pandering commercial bums
Push together or push apart
We must choose from the very start
Or live our lives by others' ways
Inculcated precepts in a nebulous daze

The confusion of this labyrinth
is driving me insane.
My hopes of understanding
At times seem so inane.
I know I must keep pushing
In search of my forte.
With fortitude I won't look back
Truth will point my way.
The choice is yours
Do you take a chance?
Give up your old walk
Learn to prance?
Do you search out the truth
Through a laborious task?
Unfold your soul
Strip off the mask?
I think the choice
Is clear to me.
I want to know
I want to see.
I want to emerge
From this rut I'm in.
To a worthwhile existence
and a chance to win.

Do your best, move ahead
Disregard what some have said.
State your goals, make your way
Don't look back, except to say,
I gave it a shot, kept trudging along
Now look how far that I have come
Don't measure your worth by what others say
Appreciate yourself in your own special way.
Give it a shot, keep truding along
Only look back, to see where you've come.
Happiness can only be brought by you
So, you must choose what you will do.

Up on that shelf is a book.
You read it last summer, you told me you did.
You said its impact made you what you said.
Up on that shelf is a book.
From cover to cover you read it before
it filled you with rage, it made you cry,
it made you sigh, it made you laugh,
it made you die.
It broke you, it stroked you,
it made you new
You said it changed you.
Enlightened you
You said
Up on that shelf is a book.
You flew to Greece all alone,
you said you needed to be on your own
You stopped by here before you left,
you help me close just for a sec
Then you pushed me back with out stretched arms,
you gazed in my eyes as if to say
I won't be back, can't tell you why,
my soul's alive, I've got to fly.
Up on that shelf is a book.
After many summers you returned from your travel,
but the enigma of you would never unravel.
You seemed content but aloof in a way,
and about your travels 
you never did say.
